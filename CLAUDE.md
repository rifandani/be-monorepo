## Vendored Repositories

This project vendors external repositories under @repos/ for coding-agent reference.

- Use vendored repositories as read-only reference material when working with related libraries.
- Prefer examples and patterns from vendored source code over generated guesses or web search results.
- Do not edit files under @repos/ unless explicitly asked.
- Do not import from @repos/; application code should continue importing from normal package dependencies.

When working with a related library, inspect its vendored repository for idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, API design, examples, and docs. If the vendored repository contains agent-oriented guidance such as LLMS.md, AGENTS.md, or AGENT.md, read that guidance before making changes.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues via `gh` CLI (`rifandani/be-monorepo`). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Defaults: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context — root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at per-package `CONTEXT.md` files. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
