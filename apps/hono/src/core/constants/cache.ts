  Simple Nasi Goreng Recipe:
  This recipe uses chicken and egg, but you can easily substitute shrimp, tofu, or just add more vegetables. The key is the sweet soy sauce (Kecap Manis)!
  Yields: 2 servings
  Prep time: 15 minutes
  Cook time: 15 minutes
  Ingredients:
  Rice:
  3 cups cooked white rice, cold and preferably day-old (this prevents mushy rice)
  Protein:
  1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 150g / 5oz), cut into small bite-sized pieces
  2 large eggs
  Aromatics & Vegetables:
  2 cloves garlic, minced
  1 large shallot, thinly sliced (or 1/4 cup diced yellow onion)
  1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots mix (optional, or use other simple veggies like chopped green beans)
  1 green onion, thinly sliced (for garnish and flavor)
  Sauce & Seasoning:
  2-3 tablespoons Kecap Manis (Indonesian Sweet Soy Sauce) - This is key!
  1 tablespoon regular soy sauce (or to taste)
  1 teaspoon Sambal Oelek (chili paste) - optional, for heat
  Salt and black pepper to taste
  Cooking Oil:
  2-3 tablespoons neutral cooking oil (like vegetable, canola, or peanut oil)
  Optional Garnish:
  Sliced cucumber
  Tomato wedges
  Extra fried shallots (store-bought is fine)
  Equipment:
  Large skillet or Wok
  Spatula or wooden spoon
  Instructions:
  Prepare Ingredients: Make sure your rice is cold and break up any large clumps with your fingers or a fork. Have all your chopped chicken, minced garlic, sliced shallots/onion, and sauces measured out and ready near the stove (mise en place). Lightly beat 1 egg in a small bowl.
  Cook Chicken: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces, season lightly with salt and pepper, and stir-fry until cooked through and lightly browned (about 3-5 minutes). Remove the chicken from the wok and set aside.
  Sauté Aromatics: Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok. Add the minced garlic and sliced shallots (or onion). Stir-fry for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant and softened, but not burnt.
  Scramble Egg: Push the aromatics to one side of the wok. Pour the beaten egg onto the empty side. Let it set slightly, then scramble it quickly with your spatula. Once cooked, mix it in with the aromatics.
  Add Veggies (if using): Add the frozen peas and carrots mix to the wok. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until heated through.
  Add Rice: Add the cold, broken-up rice to the wok. Stir-fry constantly, breaking up any remaining clumps, for about 2-3 minutes until the rice is heated through. Use your spatula to press and toss the rice.
  Sauce and Combine: Pour the Kecap Manis, regular soy sauce, and Sambal Oelek (if using) over the rice. Add the cooked chicken back into the wok. Stir-fry vigorously for another 2-3 minutes, ensuring the sauce coats the rice evenly and everything is well combined. Taste and add more soy sauce or Kecap Manis if needed.
  Finish: Stir in most of the sliced green onions (save some for garnish). Remove from heat.
  Fry Remaining Egg (Optional Topping): While the rice is resting, quickly heat a small amount of oil in a separate small pan and fry the remaining egg sunny-side up or over easy.
  Serve: Divide the Nasi Goreng between two plates. Top each serving with a fried egg (if using). Garnish with the remaining green onions, sliced cucumber, and tomato wedges. Enjoy immediately!
  Tips for Success:
  Use Day-Old Rice: This is the most important tip! Freshly cooked rice has too much moisture and will result in soggy Nasi Goreng. If you must use fresh rice, spread it on a baking sheet and let it cool completely, even chilling it in the fridge for an hour helps.
  Kecap Manis: Don't skip this! It provides the signature sweet and savory flavor. Find it in Asian markets or the international aisle of larger supermarkets. If you absolutely can't find it, you can approximate it by mixing soy sauce with brown sugar or molasses, but the real thing is best.
  High Heat: Use medium-high to high heat when stir-frying to get a slight char and prevent steaming.
  Don't Overcrowd the Pan: If your pan isn't large enough, cook in batches.

  Simple Beef Rendang Recipe:
  This version focuses on achieving tender beef and a thick, flavourful sauce without some of the harder-to-find ingredients or extremely long cooking times of hyper-traditional recipes.
  Yields: 4-6 servings
  Prep time: 30 minutes
  Cook time: 2 - 2.5 hours (mostly simmering)
  Ingredients:
  Beef:
  1 kg (approx 2.2 lbs) beef chuck, brisket, or round steak, cut into large cubes (about 1.5-2 inch / 4-5 cm)
  Spice Paste (Bumbu):
  8-10 shallots, roughly chopped (or 1 large yellow onion)
  5 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
  1 inch (2.5 cm) ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
  1 inch (2.5 cm) galangal, peeled and roughly chopped (if you can't find it, use extra ginger, but galangal adds a unique flavour)
  2-4 red chilies (like Serrano or Fresno), deseeded if you prefer less heat, roughly chopped (adjust to your spice preference)
  1 tablespoon ground coriander
  1 teaspoon ground cumin
  1 teaspoon turmeric powder
  2 tablespoons cooking oil (for blending, if needed)
  Braising Liquids & Aromatics:
  2 cans (400ml / 13.5 oz each) full-fat coconut milk
  1 cup (240 ml) water
  2 stalks lemongrass, white part only, bruised well with the back of a knife
  4-5 kaffir lime leaves (tear them slightly)
  1 cinnamon stick (optional, but adds warmth)
  1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
  1 tablespoon brown sugar or palm sugar (Gula Melaka if available)
  Kerisik (Toasted Coconut Paste - Essential):
  1 cup (approx 100g) unsweetened desiccated coconut
  Equipment:
  Food processor or blender
  Large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven
  Instructions:
  Make the Kerisik: Heat a dry skillet or wok over medium-low heat. Add the desiccated coconut. Toast, stirring constantly, until it turns a deep golden brown (be careful not to burn it). This takes about 5-10 minutes. Immediately remove from the pan. Let it cool slightly, then pound it in a mortar and pestle or process it in a small food processor/spice grinder until it becomes a dark, oily paste. Set aside. This step is crucial for authentic Rendang flavour and texture.
  Make the Spice Paste (Bumbu): Combine all spice paste ingredients (shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, chilies, ground coriander, cumin, turmeric) in a food processor or blender. Blend until it forms a relatively smooth paste. Add a tablespoon or two of oil if needed to help it blend.
  Sauté the Paste: Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in your large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the spice paste and sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5-7 minutes, until it's fragrant, darkens slightly, and the oil starts to separate from the paste.
  Brown the Beef: Add the beef cubes to the pot. Increase the heat slightly and stir to coat the beef with the spice paste. Cook for a few minutes until the beef starts to brown on the surfaces.
  Add Liquids and Aromatics: Pour in the coconut milk and water. Add the bruised lemongrass stalks, kaffir lime leaves, cinnamon stick (if using), salt, and brown/palm sugar. Stir everything well to combine.
  Simmer: Bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot loosely (leaving a small gap for steam to escape). Let it simmer gently for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally (more often towards the end) to prevent sticking.
  Reduce and Thicken: After 1.5-2 hours, the beef should be getting tender, and the liquid should have reduced significantly. Remove the lid. Continue simmering, stirring more frequently now, allowing the sauce to evaporate and thicken.
  Add Kerisik: Once the sauce is quite thick and you can see the oil separating from the coconut milk (it will look oily), stir in the prepared Kerisik (toasted coconut paste).
  Final Cook: Continue cooking and stirring for another 15-30 minutes. The Rendang is ready when the beef is very tender, and the sauce is dark, very thick (almost dry), oily, and clings beautifully to the meat.
  Adjust and Serve: Taste and adjust seasoning if needed (more salt or sugar). Remove the lemongrass stalks, kaffir lime leaves, and cinnamon stick before serving. Serve hot with steamed jasmine rice.
  Tips for Success:
  Patience is Key: Rendang needs time for the flavours to meld and the beef to become tender. Don't rush the simmering process.
  Low Heat Simmer: Keep the heat low during simmering to prevent burning and allow the beef to tenderize properly.
  Stir: Especially towards the end when the sauce is thick, stir frequently to prevent the bottom from catching and burning.
  Kerisik: Don't skip this step! It adds essential nutty depth and helps thicken the sauce correctly. Toast it carefully - burnt coconut tastes bitter.
  Better the Next Day: Like many stews, Rendang often tastes even better the day after it's made!
